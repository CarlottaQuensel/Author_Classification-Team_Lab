- generally: focus on our own invented task and goals of the project, cut some technical details if necessary

- Task description longer than usual 
	- focus on our thought process for goals and data
	- example for data/goal (poem -> author) and preprocessing

- Baseline: don't explain too much, MAYBE:
	- problems/hard parts of the implementation
	- short overview of architecture = classes/methods
	-> ONLY if there is time for that

- Experimental design: research hypothesis, e.g. 
	- are bag-of-word features enough
	- how does the number of authors influence the classification results

- Next steps: show task division and end goal, e.g.
	- goal: classifier that is especially good for poems
	- division: architectures (MaxEnt vs. NN vs. ...) and features (stanzas/verses/rhymes/...)
